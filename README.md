# Identification of Potential Lead Molecule for Schizophrenia Through Docking-Based Approach

This repository hosts materials related to the project conducted as part of the **Computer-Aided Drug Design** module at **Jaypee University of Information Technology (JUIT), Solan, India**.

## Project Overview
This project focused on utilizing molecular docking techniques to identify potential lead molecules targeting the DDR3 receptor, implicated in schizophrenia. The study combined computational tools with drug design methodologies to propose novel compounds for therapeutic exploration.

The work was presented as a poster at the **National Symposium on Current Scenario in Biological Sciences (NSCSB)** and won the **3rd Prize in Poster Presentation**. The research was supervised by **Dr. Chittaranjan Rout (Deceased, 2019)**.

## Timeline
